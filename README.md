# Advent of Code 2024
C++ solutions... hopefully I don't die halfway through like last year

# How to Run
Install a C++20 Compiler and compile the file for the day you want to test.
I did not include a day selector this year so each file is an executable that simply asks you for the name of the file with the input.
If I become bored I might add a token input option for each one.
