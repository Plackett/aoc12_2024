# Advent of Code 2024
C++ solutions... hopefully I don't die halfway through like last year

# How to Run
Install a C++20 Compiler and compile the file for the day you want to test.
I did not include a day selector this year so each file is an executable that simply asks you for the name of the file with the input.
If I become bored I might add a token input option for each one.

# Day 7 Update
I have received an anonymous challenge to rewrite my code in rust so I have created a folder titled Rust Rewrite where ill put all my rewritten code.

# Day 8 Update
all rust code is now inside the src folder and all C++ code is inside the src-cpp folder. Use CMake to compile the C++ solutions by uncommenting that one day in CMakeLists.txt. For the rust solutions just `cargo run` using the rust files to compile it, everything is connected to main.rs.
